<h1>Networking</h1>

<h2>Connecting to a hub</h2>

Create a DCHub object with parameters address and port, you
can also specify user authentication data if you like (which allows
multiple IDs across multiple hubs).

You will need to run a message loop, where you call 
SocketMonitor::poll() once in a while. This method will poll all 
sockets for events and trigger the necessary callbacks, and thus should be 
called multiple times per seconds in a tight loop. 
You can specify how long each poll will block in milliseconds.


<h1>Protocol and socket handling</h1>

<p>
To handle network IO, create a class you derive from <code>SocketEventHandler</code>.
Implement the required functions:
	<ul>
		<li><code>EventHostLookup</code></li>
		<li><code>EventHostFound</code></li>
		<li><code>EventConnecting</code></li>
		<li><code>EventConnected</code></li>
		<li><code>EventTimeout</code></li>
		<li><code>EventDisconnected</code></li>
		<li><code>EventDataAvailable</code></li>
		<li><code>EventError</code></li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
The socket class is 100% asynchronous so the above functions is used to notify all 
the socket class's event changes.
</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
Create a <code>Socket</code> object with the SocketEventHandler class (can be in the same class), a hostname/address and a port.
The Socket class will automatically buffer anything that is written (via <code>write()</code>), so that you don't need to worry about that. A possible issue could be whether or not the write buffer will grow if the connection is slow, and in those cases is it a good idea to disconnect the client or what should be done do prevent excessive memory usage? -- But that's another story.
</p>

<p>
Anything received can be gotten with a call to <code>read()</code>. However, that will return immediately without reading anything if there isn't anything to actually read yet. You can use the EventDataAvailable event to check for data available events. In that case a <code>read()</code> is guaranteed to return data.
</p>
<p>
The DC protocol reader will read when data is available and simply push this data into the <code>DCCommandProxy</code> (proxy). This will then search repeatedly for the occurence of a command separator '|' (pipe), until it doesn't find one. If a command separator is found then, the 
command will be looked up and handed off to the relevant <code>DCCommandParser</code> (parser). Otherwise, more data is needed before the command can be processed.
</p>
<p>
A parser consists of an <code>invoke()</code> method that will parse and do the relevant things based on the command. A
parser will automatically register itself to the specified <code>DCCommandProxy</code> using the <code>registerParser()</code> method when created, and
will unregister when deleted. 
</p>
<p>
If the proxy encounters a command for which it does not have a parser, it will run the defaultHandler(), which is equalient to 
doing nothing, except notifying the user, or logging a message about the command.
</p>
<p>
This overall structure have the advantage, that it will be possible to extend the protocol parser by creating <em>plug-ins</em> that registers to the proxyat either link time, or run time (in the future). However there would have to be more APIs exposed to accomplish this.
</p>
<p>
It is not recommended to write commands over the network directly, but rather have a class that will ensure optimal command flusing and escaping
possibly dangerous characters. Such a mechanism exists in the proxy, where you can use the write() functions.
