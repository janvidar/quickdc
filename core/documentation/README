1) Building on Linux

   Simply run make or use the build.sh script.

2) Building on Solaris

   Simply run make. However, you need to make sure
   your libraries such as libstdc++.so.5 are located where
   they should, or you can set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the
   directory they exist in.

3) Building on MacOSX

   Simply run make or use the build.sh script.

4) Building on Win32

   First of all install MinGW, make sure they are added to 
   your path. 
   Create a batch file called "uname.bat", it should simply 
   just contain "@echo win32", and must be located in path.
   Now, simply run make.
