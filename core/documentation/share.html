<h1>Share module overview</h1>
<p>
The <code>ShareManager</code> is running in a separate process, 
where the main process is communicating with the <code>ShareManager</code> 
through a pipe. This is done in the main process as an asynchronous poll, while 
the ShareManager is a synchronous process.
</p>
<p>
For this very reason, the ShareManager have a protocol on it's own, so that it 
can communicate over the pipe. This is a binary protocol.
</p>

<h2>Process protocol</h2>

<p>
	Message layout: [MessageID] [length] [DATA].
	<dl>
		<dt>MessageID</dt>
			<dd>32 bit integer</dd>
		<dt>length</dt>
			<dd>32 bit integer specifying the lenght of the data block</dd>
		<dt>DATA</dt>
			<dd>The data block, depending on the message ID</dd>
	</dl>
</p>
<h2>Share Cache file</h2>
<p>
The share cache file has the following format (text file, lineseparated):

<pre>
type,size,date,hash,name

Where type is either 'd' or 'f' for directory and file, accordingly.

If type is f it means:
Where size is 64bit unsigned integer.
Date is the number of seconds since the Unix Epoch.
Hash is the TTH: hash or nothing (if not indexed)
Name is the full path to the file.

If type is 'd' it means, 
size = the number of files in this dir
date = the time the directory was last changed
hash = number of subdirectories
name = full path


<b>Example:</b>

d,2,1122650218,0,/home/janvidar/shared
f,1120,1122650216,SHA1:acc3f9923487d98dd8c90a82bd967170f6a09830,/home/janvidar/shared/readme.txt
f,1320,1122650218,,/home/janvidar/shared/readme2.txt


These are two files, one with a SHA1 hash, another without.
</pre>
