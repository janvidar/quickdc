NAME
    Tiger - Perl interface to the Tiger Hash Algorithm

SYNOPSIS
        use Tiger;

        $context = new Tiger;
        $context->reset();

        $context->add(LIST);
        $context->addfile(HANDLE);

        $digest = $context->digest();
        $string = $context->hexdigest();

        $digest = $context->hash($string);
        $string = $context->hexhash($string);

DESCRIPTION
    The Tiger module allows you to use the Tiger hash algorithm
    developed by Ross Anderson and Eli Biham in Perl programs.

    A new Tiger context object is created with the new operation.
    Multiple simultaneous digest context can be maintained if
    desired. The context is updated with the add operation which
    adds the strings contained in the *LIST* parameter.

    The final message digest value is returned by the digest
    operation as a 24-byte binary string. This operation delivers
    the result of operations since the last new or reset operation.
    Once the operation has been performed, the context must be reset
    before being used to calculate another digest value.

    Several convenience functions are also provided. The addfile
    operation takes an open file-handle and reads it until end-of
    file in 8192-byte blocks adding the contents to the context. The
    hexdigest operation calls digest and returns the result as a
    printable string of hexadecimal digits in eight-digit groups.
    The hash operation performs the complete series of steps: reset,
    add, digest on the supplied scalar value, and returns the result
    as a 24-byte binary string. The hexhash operation does the same
    thing, but returns the result in the format of the hexdigest
    operation.

    from the GNU Privacy Guard, and slightly modified to interface
    with Perl.
